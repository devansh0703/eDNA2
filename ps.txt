Identifying Taxonomy and Assessing Biodiversity from eDNA Datasets
Description	
Background

The deep ocean, encompassing vast and remote ecosystems like abyssal plains, hydrothermal vents, and seamounts, harbors a significant portion of global biodiversity, much of which remains undiscovered due to its inaccessibility. Understanding deep-sea biodiversity is critical for elucidating ecological interactions (e.g., food webs, nutrient cycling), informing conservation strategies for vulnerable marine habitats, and identifying novel eukaryotic species with potential biotechnological or ecological significance.

Environmental DNA (eDNA) has emerged as a powerful, non-invasive tool for studying these ecosystems by capturing genetic traces of organisms from environmental samples, such as seawater or sediment, without the need for physical collection or disturbance of fragile habitats. By targeting marker genes like 18S rRNA or COI, eDNA enables the detection of diverse eukaryotic taxa, including protists, cnidarians, and rare metazoans, offering insights into species richness and community structure.

Description

The Centre for Marine Living Resources and Ecology (CMLRE) will undertake routine voyages to the deep sea and collect sediment and water samples from hotspot regions for biodiversity assessment and ecosystem monitoring. The water and sediment samples will be used to extract eDNA and will be subject to high-throughput sequencing.

However, assigning raw eDNA sequencing reads to eukaryotic taxa or inferring their ecological roles presents significant challenges, primarily due to the poor representation of deep-sea organisms in reference databases like SILVA, PR2, or NCBI. These databases, built primarily from well-studied terrestrial or shallow-water species, lack comprehensive sequences for deep-sea eukaryotes, leading to misclassifications, unassigned reads, or underestimation of biodiversity.

Traditional bioinformatic pipelines for eDNA analysis, such as those implemented in QIIME2, DADA2, or mothur, rely heavily on sequence alignment or mapping to these databases, which is inadequate for novel or divergent deep-sea taxa. This dependency limits the discovery of new species and hinders accurate biodiversity assessments, critical for conservation in rapidly changing deep-sea environments. The computational time required for processing eDNA data exacerbates these challenges, particularly given the limitations of database-dependent methods and the complexity of eDNA datasets.

Expected Solution

To address the challenges of poor database representation and computational time in deep-sea eDNA analysis, we propose an AI-driven pipeline that uses deep learning and unsupervised learning to identify eukaryotic taxa and assess biodiversity directly from raw eDNA reads. The solution should be able to classify the sequences, annotate and estimate abundance. This solution minimizes reliance on reference databases, reduces computational time through optimized workflows, and enables the discovery of novel taxa and ecological insights in deep-sea ecosystems.
